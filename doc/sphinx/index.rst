qbitkit Official Documentation
===================================

qbitkit is a framework that makes quantum computing a little easier by offering developers high-level abstractions to perform various tasks useful to quantum computing.
While the API for qbitkit is at this point fully documented, documentation besides API doc and gate specification does not exist at present.
You can track the progress of our continued documentation efforts here: https://github.com/qbitkit/qbitkit/issues/42
