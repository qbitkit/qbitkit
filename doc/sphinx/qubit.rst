Intro to Qubits
===============

Qubits are the most fundamental unit of any quantum computer,
in much the same way bits are the most fundamental unit of any classical computer.
Before we get too deep into talking about quantum bits, lets first try to understand
their classical counterpart. One bit can represent one of two states,
just like a light switch can be either ON or OFF at any given point in time.
