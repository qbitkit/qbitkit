Types of Quantum Computers
==========================
There are many different architectures of quantum computers, however unlike
the different architectures of classical computers (x86, Arm, RISC) the differences
between them are much more subtle than different instruction sets.

1. Superconducting Qubits
=========================
By far the most popular architecture of all, involving the use of cryogenic
hardware to unlock the superconductive properties of certain metals. Qubits
are driven using controlled pulses of microwave radiation emitted from an
Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG). For measurements, the same AWG is used
to read the qubit's state. Both the pulses used to drive the qubit as well
as the measurements being taken are carried along control lines, typically
one per qubit on current systems.
