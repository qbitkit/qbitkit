### `sign_release.sh`
* Description: Use Qubes Split GPG to securely sign releases.
* Pre-requisites: You need Qubes OS installed and up-to-date with 
* Notes: You **must** take the highest possible precautions when building and signing new releases. **Do not use GPG without a Smart Card!** Even if you have your keys in a separate VM and access them with Qubes Spit GPG, your key material is still stored on your system's disk. For the highest level of security, please make sure to use a Smart Card device such as a Smart Card with a USB Smart Card reader or a Yubikey. I use my personal Yubikey 4 in conjunction with Qubes Split GPG to sign all `qbitkit` releases with the highest possible levels of security. To build new releases, new disposable machines are started to build a release, and destroyed immediately afterwards. This significantly decreases the amount of state the system holds, thus making it more difficult for an adversary to compromise the building and signing process.
